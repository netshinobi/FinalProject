The JUTC Helper App focuses on displaying information about the bus routes that are located in each area.

to see these bus route, the user clicks(touches) a picture of an area amongst the horizontal list and they

are given a list with each expanding on further details. there is a switch that darkens the list for those users with sensitive eyes.

there is also an "about us" button that displays a dialog box about the company. if the user so wishes, they can move to the next

Tab which displays a map of jamaica.
